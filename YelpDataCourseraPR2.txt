Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000 rows
ii. Business table = 10000 rows
iii. Category table = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 10000
v. elite_years table = 10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table = 10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000 id's
ii. Hours = 1562 business_id's
iii. Category = 2643 business_id's
iv. Attribute = 1115 business_id's
v. Review = 8090 business_id's, 9581 user_id's
vi. Checkin = 493 business_id's
vii. Photo = 6493 business_id's
viii. Tip = 537 user_id's, 3979 business_id's
ix. User = 10000 id's
x. Friend = 11 user_id's
xi. Elite_years = 2780 user_id's

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no 
	
	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer: 

	select count(*) from user where id is null or name is null or review_count is null or 
	yelping_since is null or useful is null or funny is null or cool is null or fans is null or 
	average_stars is null or compliment_hot is null or compliment_more is null or compliment_profile
	is null or compliment_cute is null or compliment_list is null or compliment_note is null or compliment_plain is null 
	or compliment_plain is null or compliment_cool is null or compliment_funny 
	is null or compliment_writer is null or compliment_photos is null
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars

7. Find the top 3 users based on their total number of reviews:
		
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select name, review_count from user
order by review_count desc
limit 3
		
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:
		
+--------+--------------+
| name   | review_count |

| Gerald |         2000 |
| Sara   |         1629 |
| Yuri   |         1339 |
+--------+--------------+

8. Does posting more reviews correlate with more fans?

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	
No, posting more reviews does not correlate with more fans. When we run the following code: 
select name, review_count, fans from user
order by fans desc
we see that Amy with 609 reviews has the most fans at 503 while Gerald with 2000 reviews has 253 fans, almost half of Amy's.

	
9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	Answer: Yes. There are 1780 reviews with "love" and 232 reviews with "hate" in them.

	
	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

select count(*) as 'Reviews with Love' from review where text like '%love%'
select count(*) as 'Reviews with Hate' from review where text like '%hate%'
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:
	
select name, fans from user 
order by fans desc
limit 10
	
	Copy and Paste the Result Below:

+-----------+------+
| name      | fans |
+-----------+------+
| Amy       |  503 |
| Mimi      |  497 |
| Harald    |  311 |
| Gerald    |  253 |
| Christine |  173 |

| Fran      |  124 |
| Lissa     |  120 |

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.

I will select Toronto as the city and Restaurants as the category.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
No, they do not

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
Yes, when looking at the two groups, there are more reviews in the businesses with 4-5 stars compared to reviews in the busineses with 2-3 stars.         
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.
No, all of these restaurants are relatively in the same coordinate range.

SQL code used for analysis:
select distinct(business.name), business.review_count, category.category, 
city, stars,review_count,(latitude||', '||longitude) as Coordinates
from business join category
on business.id = category.business_id 
where city is 'Toronto' and category is 'Restaurants'

+--------------------+--------------+-------------+---------+-------+---------------+-------------------+

2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Open businesses in Toronto have more reviews than the closed businesses.
         
ii. Difference 2:
More open businesses are in Little Italy while more closed businesses are in Entertainment District       
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:
select distinct(business.name), is_open, city, stars, 
review_count,(latitude||', '||longitude) as Coordinates, neighborhood
from business 
where city is 'Toronto' and is_open = 0
order by review_count desc
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
I want to see what kinds of businesses in Toronto, Canada are more prone to closing.         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
I will need to use the business and category tables to see what kinds of businesses have closed more commonly. I chose this because if someone wants to open a business, it is important to see which ones have a better chance of surviving. In the results, we can see that the restaurants tend to stay open more while hospitals did not.                          
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset: check iv.
         
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:
select distinct(business.name), is_open, category.category
from business join category
on category.business_id = business.id
where city is 'Toronto' and is_open = 1
